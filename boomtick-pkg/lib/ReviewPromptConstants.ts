export const STRICT_JSON_VERIFICATION = `Strict JSON Verification:
- You MUST self-verify the completeness and validity of the JSON block before finishing your response.
- Every finding MUST have an \`id\`, \`file\`, \`issue\`, and \`status\`.
- Ensure the JSON is well-formed and contained entirely within the \`<findings>\` tags.
- Ensure 'snippet' is a unique string from the diff that identifies the issue.`;

export const SNIPPET_AND_VERIFICATION_RULES = `Snippet and verification rules:
- STRICT SNIPPET RULE: When citing an error or anti-pattern, you MUST quote the entire, exact line from the diff in the "snippet" field. Do not truncate the line.
- Before flagging a "syntax error" or "missing property/method", re-read the diff to confirm the code isn't simply continued on the next line or truncated in the diff chunk. Hallucinating errors due to chunk truncation is a severe failure.
- If a line appears truncated in the diff (e.g. at the edge of a chunk), DO NOT assume it is a syntax error. Assume it is valid code that continues outside the visible context.`;

export const COMMON_REVIEW_GUIDELINES = `Review ONLY PR changes. Assume original code worked.
EVIDENCE RULE: Issue must point to exact line + explain runtime consequence.
FALSE POSITIVE FILTER: No speculation. Design choices are NOT bugs.

TIERED SCOPE:
- For App/UI (src/): Flag redundant wrappers. BANNED: Raw Tailwind layout (flex/grid/px-*) in TSX (use Stack/Grid/Box).
- For Infra/Tooling (scripts/, boomtick-pkg/cli/, .github/): Focus on portability, idempotency, and error handling. Avoid UI-specific feedback for low-level scripts.

REPO RULES: Prefer removal.
ANTI-SLOP: DO NOT recommend overly complex error handling, defensive guards, extra unit tests for simple internal scripts, or boilerplate documentation/comments.

- FILE NECESSITY: Question any added, moved, or removed files that look like temporary artifacts (e.g. .tmp, standalone .py in root, audit-*.md, .json dumps) or seem unrelated to the PR intent. Flag them for removal if they pollute the review context.`;

export const REVIEW_PHILOSOPHY = `## 1. Philosophy
- EVIDENCE RULE: Points to exact line + explain runtime consequence + explain why previous code was better. No speculation.
- SCOPE: Review ONLY PR changes. Ignore pre-existing issues. Assume original code worked.
- STRICT SCOPE: Only review the lines present in the diff or the provided external context.
- FALSE POSITIVE FILTER: Verify if it occurs at runtime. Design choices are NOT bugs.
- DO NOT flag "missing" imports, types, or files unless you can prove they were deleted or broken by this diff. If a symbol is used but its definition is not in the context, ASSUME it is correctly defined elsewhere.
- DO NOT hallucinate bugs in code you cannot see.
- Flag security issues ONLY if this diff introduces a NEW untrusted input path (e.g. new user-controlled data flowing somewhere it wasn't before). Do not flag pre-existing patterns.
- Do not introduce review topics unrelated to the PR's stated goal unless you find a genuine, evidence-backed regression caused by this diff.
- If parts of the diff or external context are truncated (indicated by "[TRUNCATED]"), DO NOT fail the review solely because you cannot see the full implementation of a newly introduced module or utility. Instead, provide a WARN or PASS verdict based on what you CAN see, and explicitly state what remains unverified due to truncation.`;
