## Context

## Audit Checklist

For EVERY changed file, verify against these standards. Mark as `- [x]` when verified.

- [x] Dead abstractions: No new class, context, or hook that a simpler primitive handles.
- [x] Unnecessary indirection: No layer of wrapping where a direct function call suffices.
- [x] Responsibility creep: Component does not take on state/logic belonging in parent/hook.
- [x] Import bloat: No unnecessary `import React from 'react'` (React 17+).
- [x] Token compliance: Uses established design tokens (no raw Tailwind values or inline styles).
- [x] Audit ratio: If > 100 lines added, identified at least 10 lines to refactor/remove.
